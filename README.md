## Create a Custom Subdomain

To get a short and sleek subdomain for your website using **is-a.tech**, follow these steps:

### Step 1

Go to the [is-a.tech homepage](http://is-a.tech) and fill out the form to create your custom subdomain. For example, if your name is Luis, you could create `luis.is-a.tech`.
